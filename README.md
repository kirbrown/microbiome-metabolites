# Microbiome-Metabolites
This is a compilation of R code used to generate figures for a manuscript by Brown et al entitled, "Microbiota alter the metabolome in an age- and sex- dependent manner". We welcome any feedback on the code. 

The peak file "brown_peak_table.csv" is the data file that can be used as a starting point to generate figures. Data in this file were generated using MINT (https://lewisresearchgroup.github.io/ms-mint-app/gui/).
